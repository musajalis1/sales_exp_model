# Modeling a sales dataset with an exponential function

In this notebook, I will be walking you through modeling data with an exponential function. The dataset provides us with sales orders over a period of a few years. The dataset contains information regarding the date of an order, the quantity of orders, the unit price, and other identifying information for each order.

For the purpose of this notebook, we will be taking a closer look at the quantity ordered and the period of time in which the orders take place. We will be using this data to build a model for total sales, that can be used to predict future sales.

We will be modelling the data using the function:  

$$
y = a * e^{b \ * \ x} 
$$
